<p><span class="tab">Families with children made up more than 70 percent of people staying in New York City's homeless shelters this fall, according to Department of Homeless Services data.</p>

<p><span class="tab">That’s only the number staying in official New York City shelters, not the new migrant housing that has been created. Many of those migrants are also families with children. But looking at the shelter data is instructive, in part because it goes back a decade.</p>

<p><span class="tab">While new migrants account for part of the increase of families in shelters, there are factors driving, according to the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness. The expiration of pandemic assistance programs and the end of a moratorium on evictions have also played a role. The institute declined to comment for this story. </p>

<p><span class="tab">Homeless children’s “educational instability – made devastatingly clear during the pandemic – will need to be addressed to support them now and as part of a long-term response to homelessness,” the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness wrote in a recent report.</p>
